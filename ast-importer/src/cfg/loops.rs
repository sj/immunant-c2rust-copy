//! This module contains stuff related to choosing better loops in Relooper. The problem is simple:
//! there is a point in the relooper algorithm where we commit to making a `Loop` structure. At that
//! point, we partition blocks into those that go into the loop and those that go after the loop.
//!
//! Relooper gives us a handful of blocks which _must_ go in the loop, but we have some freedom to
//! choose which other blocks we want to also push into the loop.
//!
//! Our choice can be informed by one of two strategies:
//!
//!   * _Do what C does_. We can try to match what C does by keeping track of which blocks in CFG
//!     formed loops in the initial C source. This information needs to be built up when initially
//!     building the CFG .
//!
//!   * _Try to avoid jump-table's_. The more entries we push into the loop, the more we risk
//!     creating a massive loop that starts with a jump table. OTOH, the more entries we put after
//!     the loop, the more likely we are to have a jump table right after the loop.
//!
